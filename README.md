# CourseManagementSystem

The project is basically a CRUD application and I also added relationships between Course-Student and Batch-Student.

I have used identity server for login and register user and without user login the users cannot access the Student, Course and Batch list or cannot 
perform any CRUD operation. 

I have used a theme from Bootswatch and used that template all over my project. 

Entity Framework(ORM) is used for all the database operation. 

ViewModels are also used to pass different table data in the view. 

MVC pattern is followed in this project. 

Eager Loading is used to bring all the related entity with it to show the data in table.

Also implemented searching and paging via DataTable which is a jQuery plugin.
